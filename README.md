### What I learned

I enjoyed practicing JavaScript, reinforcing some and learning new ones.

Examples:
```js
switch (option) {
        case 'opt1':
            opt1.classList.add('changeButtonColor');
            break;
}
```
```js
opt2.classList.contains('changeButtonColor');
```
```js
ratingSelected.textContent = '1';
```
